    <p>I am an intelligent, sensitive human being with the soul of a clown which always forces me to blow it at the most important moments. That is just by the way though, It is something I have said to myself for a long time now and it stuck, Usually, it is mostly used as a coping or defensive mechanism, when I get frustrated or angry, all I can do is joke or clown around to get my mind off it.</p>
    <p>My childhood was fun, made a lot of legendary memories with my awesome siblings and friends whom I consider to be my family. Fast-forward to my University (<a href="https://futminna.edu.ng/"><em><strong>FUT Minna</em></strong></a>) days, my worst days on earth. My first three years in school was hell, I had no idea what I was doing, you know; New environment and all. Also, it was the first time in my life I was away from my family, so it was hard, frustrating and depressing.</p>
    <p>Things were so bad, I had to do things to get an extra buck or stay afloat because nothing or little was coming from home. Things like running assignments, technical drawings, designs, tracing, e.t.c. just to survive in school. Even with all the hustle and bustle, it was not enough to do anything, so I got frustrated and engaged in some extra-corriculum activities. I am not going to cast myself by listing all of it but just know I played soccer, video games, and also took random strolls to unknown destinations.</p>
    <p>Through my tribulation, I had the privilege of meeting the most amazing, compassionate and loyal set of friends who always came through for me whenever I needed them. We joked and laughed about everything, even at our troubles and problems. We called ourselves "SPILLOS" (a term given to students who are unable to graduate at the given time of a course of study). These guys basically made me forget about everything problematic in my life, I learnt from them also, that you could have lots of problems and still be at peace with yourself and so I found solace in a quote by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Fumero"><em><strong>MELISSA FUMERO;</em></strong></a> She said and I quote <em> <strong>"Life is unpredictable. Not everything is in our control, but as long as we have God and we are with the right people, we can handle anything".</em></strong></p>
    <p>That quote stuck with me and gave me the ability to look at things from a different perspective. My result was not great but it did not deter me from graduating and when I finally did graduate, It was the most overwhelming, yet exhilarating feeling ever. It was as if the world itself had been lifted off my head and I felt light for the first time in many years.</p>
    <p>Another phase of my life began when I went for my <a href="https://www.nysc.gov.ng/"><em><strong>Youth Service.</strong></em></a> The experience was short-lived because I expected so much from the hype of it all but I can not say it was all bad, I made new friends, engaged in games and other activities and even found parts of myself within me I never knew or thought existed. So, this is me or my story in a nutshell. <strong>Please, do not be fooled or misled into thinking you know me or understand how or why I behave the way I do by reading this bio, this is barely the surface of my complexity.ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€</strong></p>
    <p><em>ENJOY!!!</em></p>
